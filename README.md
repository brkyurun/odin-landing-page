# My project as part of my learning over at "The Odin Project"

   Highly recommended anyone interested in learning web development to check The Odin Project out. Although it may seem difficult, I learned much more in a week than I did in a month and a half previously.
   
# About the project

    Honestly it's trash, but I had a lot of fun making it and learned a lot of stuff! I may even dare say I took a few solid steps towards getting over my CSS fear!
